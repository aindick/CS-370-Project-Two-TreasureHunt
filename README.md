# CS-370-Project-Two-TreasureHunt

Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: 

- What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?
  
  For the Treasure Hunting Game, I was given the TreasureHuntGame.ipynb, which I renamed to Indick_Alexis_ProjectTwo, and was required to create the deep Q-learning
  a portion of the code. Everything else was given to me code-wise. I was also given other Python module files, treasureMaze.py and GameExperiance.py, that I did 
  not include here that were for setting up the matrix so the AI can navigate the maze and the controller that handled the initial and terminal game states, 
  respectively. The deep Q-Learning algorithm helped the AI player to move around the maze to find the treasure at the end.

Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:


- What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?


- How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?


- What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
