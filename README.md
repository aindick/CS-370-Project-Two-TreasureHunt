# CS-370-Project-Two-TreasureHunt

Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: 

- What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?
  
  For the Treasure Hunting Game, I was given the TreasureHuntGame.ipynb, which I renamed to Indick_Alexis_ProjectTwo, and was required to create the deep Q-learning
  a portion of the code. Everything else was given to me code-wise. I was also given other Python module files, treasureMaze.py and GameExperiance.py, that I did 
  not include here that were for setting up the matrix so the AI can navigate the maze and the controller that handled the initial and terminal game states, 
  respectively. The deep Q-Learning algorithm helped the AI player to move around the maze to find the treasure at the end.

Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:


- What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?

  Computer Scientists are the ones who help solve problems in a programmatic way. Using AI specifically to solve some problems like finding the best route possible
  and finding a faster solution to a problem is important for many jobs that want to use AI for these reasons so computer scientists have an important job when 
  making AI solutions. This matters a lot with jobs that require fast-thinking and quick solutions like customer service chatbots or data analytics.

- How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?

  I approach a problem as a computer scientist by first analyzing what the problem is as a bigger picture. What is the end goal of the project, if there is one?
  Then, I break each part of the problem down into smaller parts that are manageable if the problem feels overwhelming. Smaller tasks help me to make sure I'm
  covering each edge case of the issue. 


- What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
