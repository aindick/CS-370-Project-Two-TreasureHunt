# CS-370-Project-Two-TreasureHunt

Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: 

- What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?
  
  For the Treasure Hunting Game, I was given the treasurehuntgame.ipynb, which I renamed to Indick_Alexis_ProjectTwo, and was required to create the deep Q-learning
  a portion of the code. Everything else was given to me code-wise. I was also given other Python module files that I did not include here.

Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:


- What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?


- How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?


- What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
